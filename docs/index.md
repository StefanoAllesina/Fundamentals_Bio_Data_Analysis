# Fundamentals of Biological Data Analysis

**by Dmitry Kondrashov & Stefano Allesina**, Fall Quarter 2020

## Goals

* Learn how to use R for working with biological data 
* Become familiar with probability theory and the assumptions of popular models
* Encounter and learn how to avoid common statistical mistakes

## Approach

* Mix of theory and practice
* Apply what you're learning to your own data
